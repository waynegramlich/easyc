Easy-C Downloads

								<P>
The Easy-C compiler is available as a single
download file called
    <A HRef="releases/latest/easy_c.zip">
easy_c.zip</A>.  You download the file (< 1MB),
unpack it, and read the file called
    <A HRef="README.txt">
README.txt</A>.  The easy_c.zip file contains
1) a Linux executable, 2) all source files,
and 3) a bootstrap script.  That is all there is to it.

I suspect that it would be possible to bootstap
the compiler onto MacOS.  Windows would be a
bit more problematic, but it would probably work
using
    <A HRef="http://www.cygwin.org/">
CyWin</A>.  I have not bothered to investigate
either the MacOS or Windows option very carefully
due to an extreme lack of interest on my part.
