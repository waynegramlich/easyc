All rights reserved.

This is the README.txt file for the Easy-C compiler.

It should be one of the files included with the easy_c.zip
download file.

License:

Currently, this code is not under any of the popular
open source licenses.  There are so many to choose
from, I will wait until somebody who actually cares
asks for such a license before choosing one.  The
ultimate intention is to release this code under at
least one open source license, maybe even more than
one.

For now, that means that all of the code is copyrighted
by me, Wayne C. Gramlich.  That means I have all
rights and you have *NONE*.  If that bothers you,
just let me know and we can figure out which open
source license to use.

Installation:

Linux:

    # In some shell:
    cd {some directory}
    unzip easy_c.zip
    chmod +x ezcc

Other *nix:

    # In some shell:
    cd {some directory}
    chmod +x bootstrap.sh
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ezcc EZCC
    mv EZCC ezcc

Windows:
    # I have not tried this, but try to use CyWin:
    # Try the "Other *nix:"

Bug Reports:

Yes, I am interested in them.  The more detailed they
are, the more interested I am.  Most bug reports can
be reduced to a few lines of code.  Those bugs get
fixed in a hurry.  Big long compilicated rambling
bug reports do not get much attention from me.

Bug Fixes:

My intention is to follow the example set by the Free
Software Foundation.  FSF requires that all bug fixes of
more than about 50 lines come accompanied with either
a copyright assignment form or a copyright disclamer.
This means that I retain the copyright to the code,
but you get it back under an open source license.
This allows me to easily upgrade the license when
a license upgrade is needed (e.g. GPL 2 => GPL 3.)
